Can't miss the chance to play a rogue in [Dungeons and Dragons](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/17181/dungeons-dragons-5th-edition), and owns some (really outdated) Pokémon cards.

![Jyo K.](/images/committee/JyoK.jpg){:class="img_committee"}

Jyo loves strategy games.
Complex mechanics, minimal luck, cut throat competition?
Bring it on!

# Kathy J.

![Kathy J.](/images/committee/KathyJ.jpg){:class="img_committee"}

Kathy generally prefers co-op games, especially [Pandemic]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Pandemic.Link }}).
But she can’t resist [Ticket to Ride]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.TicketToRideEurope.Link }}), [Tikal]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Tikal.Link }}), [Magical Athlete]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.MagicalAthlete.Link }}), or [Braggart]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Braggart.Link }}).
Kathy has been our main reviewer on the website, so you have a fair idea from what she’s been reviewing!

# Ross D.

![Ross D.](/images/committee/RossD.jpg){:class="img_committee"}

Ross started his geekvangelism with [Arkham Horror]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.ArkhamHorror.Link }}) and [Dominion]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Dominion.Link }}) (which are still some of his favourites).
He loves co-operative games and now he loves [XCOM]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.XCOM.Link }}), [Spirit Island]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.SpiritIsland.Link }}), [Aeon’s End]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.AeonsEnd.Link }}), and [Sentinels of the Multiverse]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.SentinelsOfTheMultiverse.Link }}).
When he remembers that he should play some competitive games, he plays [Caverna]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Caverna.Link }}), [Dungeon Petz]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.DungeonPetz.Link }}) (he loves the artwork on this one), and [Isle of Skye]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.IsleOfSkye.Link }}).

He absolutely loves playing RPGs, the reason he’s helping with the club is to give other people a chance to start.  He has a varied background and plays everything from [Dungeons & Dragons (4th ed.)](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/190/dungeons-dragons-4th-edition), [Shadowrun (5th ed.)](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/21069/shadowrun-5th-edition), and [Fate](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/26506/fate-core).  He’s also currently learning to run others for more variety to teach at the club, including [Blades in the Dark](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/26952/blades-dark), [Scum and Villainy](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/48736/scum-and-villainy), Sentinels Comics RPG, and [Carbon 2185](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpg/56987/carbon-2185).

# Simon W.

![Simon W.](/images/committee/SimonW.jpg){:class="img_committee"}

Simon owns a few games (too many if he's honest) and will evade picking a favourite – it so depends on the mood and group. The last few years have seen a renewed interest in train games, mainly cube rails but also getting back into the more complex train games. Favourite designers include: Amabel Holland, Martin Wallace, anything from Splotter (very fond of games by Richard Breese, Mac Gerdts, Reiner Knizia, and Uwe Rosenberg). If you're looking for something "lighter" he’ll often suggest [Telestrations]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Telestrations.Link }}), [Hossa!]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Hossa.Link }}), [Turn the Tide]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.TurnTheTide.Link }}), [P.I.]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.PI.Link }}), [Flamme Rouge]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.FlammeRouge.Link }}). For the main part he'll typically suggest [Concordia]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Concordia.Link }}), [Edo]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Edo.Link }}), [Caylus]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Caylus.Link }}), [Terra Mystica]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.TerraMystica.link }}), [Irish Gauge]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.IrishGauge.Link }}), [Keyflower]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Keyflower.Link }}). If you want a bigger game then out come the Splotter/GMT/heavy economy games like [Antiquity]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Antiquity.Link }}), [Eldritch Horror]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.EldritchHorror.Link }}), [Container]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Container.Link }}), [Graenaland]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.Graenaland.Link }}), [Roads & Boats]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.RoadsAndBoats.Link }}), [Space Empires 4X]({{ site.data.BoardGameLinks.SpaceEmpires4X.Link }}), or some [18xx](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/18xx).
He was a serious [GURPs](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgfamily/333/gurps) and [Ars Magica](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgfamily/1029/ars-magica) fan in the past, with a soft spot for the Classic and Cinematic [Unisystem](https://rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/627/unisystem) (i.e. Buffy RPG). However he's now more in love with [Fate](https://www.rpggeek.com/rpgsystem/26506/fate-core) and [Lasers & Feelings](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/23290/lasers-feelings) (and the many derivatives, especially Books & Bikes).
