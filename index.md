# What is St. Ives Tabletop?

St Ives Tabletop is a fortnightly tabletop gaming group for the area around St. Ives, Cambridgeshire.

We cover:
* Tabletop role-playing games (RPGs), of which we have a good amount of experience running; and
* Board games, of which we have hundreds between us!


# Next session

We hold fortnightly sessions on Wednesday evenings.

## Charity Night

November 29th - save the date for the annual charity night! This is traditionally our last session before Christmas. There will be no entrance fee, instead donations will be taken. There will also be a games raffle and a bake sale (please bring along cakes and biscuits to donate).  All donations will be given to a local charity. We have previously supported EACH and St Ives food bank, but if you have any other suggestions please [contact us][contact].
