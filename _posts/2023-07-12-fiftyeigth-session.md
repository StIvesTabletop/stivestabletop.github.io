title: Fifty eighth session - Life, Lucre and Liquor
---

We had 15 attendees, including 3 first timers, and played a mix of new and old games mostly with themes about life, money and spirit making.

The night started with some favourite short games of [Ecosystem: Coral Reef][ECR] and [High Society][HS] before splitting into groups for some larger games.

One of the big games of the night was [Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition][TMAR].
For those not familiar with [Ares Expedition][TMAR], it is a simplified version of its [bigger brother][TM], with
streamlined engine building mechanics, many similar project cards and the same corporations but
no city building. Despite having a board roughly the same size as a mouse mat, it still has a fairly
large footprint due to the high number of cards involved. Early play saw Helion able to exploit its
heat production bonus and take a handy lead in terraform rating, but the other corps gradually
made up the difference giving what looked like a very close finish. Or not. With the main card deck
divided into two halves for ease of play, final scoring showed that the half deck on one side of the
board had held most of the cards giving bonus victory points! All in all a very enjoyable game, but
better pre game shuffling may be needed next time!
