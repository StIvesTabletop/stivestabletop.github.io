title: Nintyfourth session - Psychics, Paintings and Planetoids
---

Fifteen gamers made it past the traffic complications in St Ives to join the session and play seven different games.

Three tables got stuck straight into some long games whilst the fourth table played a series of shorter games.

[The Castles of Burgundy][CoB] Special Edition had its first outing at club, nice to finally have this classic game on the tables. Each player controls a small princedom, trading and mining goods and trying to build settlements and castles.

[The Gallerist][TGa] was the final long game chosen, this was its second time at club having first been played fairly recently in [sesssion 85][85]. Jyo or Simon

[Mysterium Park][MP] is the slightly shorter version of [Mysterium][My] that has been played once before at club. One player is the ghost that has witnessed a murder at the creepy circus/amusement park and tries to give clues to the others via a series of abstract images. The other players have up to six rounds of visions in which to narrow down the line up of nine fairground workers and nine locations to just three pairs of possibilities. Then everyone can cooperate in viewing a final two images to narrow things down to the actual murderer and location. The four gamers had two attempts; ghost one just managed to get on the right wavelength and get to the final round and then found some excellent cards to convey the necessary visions and solve the murder. Ghost two struggled a little more and the final location was not eliminated and the murderer got away with it this time.

![Fantastic Factories](/images/posts/2025_01_22/FantasticFactories01.jpg "Fantastic Factories"){:class="img_post"}

[Fantastic Factories][FF] was selected next for its fourth time on the club tables, this game was first played in [session 45][45] which covers the basic rules. This time Richie added in the [Manufactions][FFM] expansion to add some per player unique abilities and some extra cards. The trick to winning this game is all about building an engine out of factory cards you play that can produce resources to enable you to build more buildings and create goods. But there is an element of luck with rolling the dice and then utilising these with the buildings you have, but with the expansion a new resource of vitamins can help adjust your roll. It was these vitamins that helped Richie utilise his buildings to produce 12 goods before anyone else. Kathy, Jeremy and Joe were not far behind, but this triggered the final round and everyone scrambled to utilise their factories to best add final points by building or production. Even with that final push, Richie managed a win by a few points over second place. Its a fun game with some interesting card, dice combinations that keep it a close game until the end.

![Zuuli](/images/posts/2025_01_22/Zuuli01.jpg "Zuuli"){:class="img_post"}

[Zuuli][Zu] is a nice pass and play game about fitting animals into your zoo, following certain rules about what type of terrain they prefer, how much space they need and not putting carnivores (or fierce creatures) in with the vegetarians (friendly). This game was quite popular during COVID times when club games were played online using Board Game Arena so all the players knew the rules. Played over three rounds Kathy J. got caught out in round one with not enough enclosures for all her animals leading to many negative points, whilst Jeremy J. had acquired a shoal of angler fish cards for a nice combination bonus. In the final round the tables were turned with Jeremy and Richie W. being caught with too many animals for the space available but Jeremy's mostly aquatic based points could not be beaten.

[Scout][Sc] was the last short game of the night, this simple set laying card game was back at club for its fourth play having first debuted in [session 65][65].
