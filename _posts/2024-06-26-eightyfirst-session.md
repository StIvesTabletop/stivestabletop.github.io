title: Eighty First session - Mars Attacks!

---

Fifteen gamers turned out on a hot evening to support the clubs charity night. Between the donations, bake sale and games raffle we raised Â£250 on the night to [support the St Ives Corn Exchange][Fund] which has been our host since the start of the club back in September 2019. So thanks to everyone that supported the event. 

!? add more on matching from float when agreed. 

We got stuck into some games with big player counts so there were only three long games played but one was a two table filler with six players.

Following the principle of "If you get it ready on a table then people will join" Kathy J. set up [Lost Ruins of Arnak][LRA] with the [Expedition Leaders expansion][LRAEL] and soon had a full game of four. As there was one new player, Dave took the Captain as the easiest character role, Kathy the Explorer, Iain the Professor and Steph the Falconer, and we played on the Monkey temple research track.

It was soon a master class from Steph on collecting enough resources to get both the magnifying glass and notebook to the top of their research tracks without neglecting the exploring and guardian taming. The other three players all finished about twenty points behind with similar scores and the island had been comprehensively looted and tamed. Always popular on the tables Arnak won over another first time player with its fairly simple mechanics but multiple options for actions and scoring points.

Three players then stayed on for a quick game of [Subastral][SA] a card set collecting game with a few nuances on how to maximise your scores themed around collecting biomes with scores based on diversity of biomes researched or depth of the same biomes collected. See [blog 44][44] for a more detailed description and photo.

The next table setup another popular game, the 8th time out at club, so five CEOs stepped up to the challenge of [Terraforming Mars][TM] (with the [Prelude expansion][TMP] to kick start the endeavours). Ryan (hosting the game) was head of Helion a heat management corporation, Jeremy was part of a greening focussed company called Ecoline, Jyo was leading a science group called Valley Trust, Richie was advising the United Nations Mars Initiative (UNMI) and Simon was playing as an innovator as part of the Vitor Corp.

With the prelude expansion, Mars was already partly covered by two seas and a city at the start of the game. Things went very quickly from there, and by the time everyone had been the first player Mars was nearly terraformed. The temperature had raised enough for Mangroves to be placed, nearly all the seas had been defrosted/created and all the greening had made the oxygen very high. The last couple of rounds were spent building more cities, enabling awards, adding some more green touches and playing as many victory point project cards as possible.

The game ended with UNMI having the largest Terraforming Rating, and everyone else was reasonably close behind apart from the Valley Trust. The final scoring had UNMI and Ecoline raking in the points from greenery and cities, with them sharing the Landlord award with Vitor. Then the Banker and Science awards were shared between Vitor, Helion and the Valley Trust. The milestones of Mayor, Gardener and Builder went to Ecoline, UNMI and Valley Trust respectively. Everything was looking quite close, but then the project cards played during the game were counted and though the Valley Trust had a huge increase (23) from their science projects, Ecoline swung it with 16 pets (8 points) from all the cities built during the game due to the luck of getting this card out at the start of the game.

The final table had pitched in advance on Discord and had six seats booked for its first time out at club [Aliens: Another Glorious Day in the Corps!][AGC].
