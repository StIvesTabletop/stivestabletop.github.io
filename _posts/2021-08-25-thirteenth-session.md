title: Thirteenth session - back from lockdown
---

Live sessions were able to resume on July 25th with a bumper turnout of old faces, new but previously virtual members and 10 completely new joiners who had heard about the club and came along to try. The Corn Exchange has changed a little over the last year causing some initial issues with the hot beverage provision but we managed to get the tea flowing and have some ideas to improve for next session.

With so many players we had 4 tables running for most of the night with a little interchange of players as some games finished at similar times.

Table 4 started with a 4 player session of [Clank][C], a deck building push your luck dungeon raiding game. One player had a surprising run of luck avoiding the dragon we were enraging by stealing his treasures but in the end succumbed and had to be rescued by the villagers. This meant that the only player that had managed to get out just won as the bonus for that accomplishment tipped the balance of their slightly reduced treasure pickup whilst dungeon crawling.

Then we had a slight reshuffle and some extra players joined for a 6 player game of [Ecosystem][E]. This is a tableau building game with a "pass the hand of cards" mechanic, where you build a 5 x 4 grid of animals and locations over 2 rounds with 10 cards per round. Each card type has a different way to score points depending on how many or what other cards are nearby and there is a final diversity bonus encouraging you to place many of the different card types in your ecosystem. It was a popular choice and a fairly quick game so everyone stayed on for another round.

Finally the table had a couple of 4 player of games of [King Domino][KD] building magical kingdoms from domino like tiles before wrapping up for the night.
