title: Eighty Eigth session - Stories, Planets, and Space Mushrooms
---

Sixteen gamers convened to play various games from tavern tales, building utopian planets to battling in space, with of course some fruiting mushrooms thrown in for good measure.

The night started with a couple of shorter games with 5 players - [Subastral][SA] about biome researching ([blog 44][44]) and the club favourite (28 plays) [Ecosystem][E].

Whilst these were ongoing a table started sprouting [Mycelia][M]... (Steve)

Next up [Arcs][Arcs] was back, and this time Simon brought [Leaders and Lore][LaL]. This
is an added layer on top of Base Arcs, which brings the game a bit
closer to [Root][RT] by giving each player an asymmetric power. The Leader
bestows a benefit and a drawback, while the Lore gives a benefit;
together they can radically shift your focus for scoring
points. Unlike Root, the Leader and Lore cards are drafted at the
start of the game (a bit like [Age of Innovation][AoI], among many other
examples of this).

Three players sat down to tackle this wild new take
on Base Arcs: Simon (Elder + Raider Exosuits), Janek (Demagogue +
Keeper's Sol) and Ryan (Mystic + Empath's Bond). It was a close fought
game, but two very lucky dice rolls (getting six hits on six dice, and
rolling enough keys to steal vital resources and cards) swung the game
into Simon's favour. (We did include the Leaders & Lore expansion, which
just adds extra cards to those already in the main box - don't know
whether any of those selected came form that mini-expansion or
not). Arcs is something quite interesting, it's close quarters combat
with the outcome of the game hanging by a thread - not for everyone,
but quite the experience. The Leaders and Lore seem to make Base
shine, although I suspect some combinations will be very good against
others and learning to "read" that at the start of the game will be
hard.

The shorter games finished, and tables mixed up a bit and started another couple of 5 player games [Ticket to Ride][TtR] and [Ginkgopolis][Gp].

[Ginkgopolis][Gp] is a euro game with a futuristic theme, it has a write up of rules in [session 72][72]. This time the utopian builders were Darren, Iain, Ian and Steph, with Jeremy teaching. It was an introductory game as no one but Jeremy had played before, but people soon got into the swing of how to extend and improve the city. In the end it was Ian who managed to secure a very large yellow district in the city and get 20 points which helped him nicely win the game. 
It was agreed that a repeat game next session would be welcome.

![Welcome to the Moon](/images/posts/2024_10_02/WelcomeMoon01.jpg "Welcome to the Moon"){:class="img_post"}

Whilst mushroom growing and space warfare continued, the other tables had some end games of the night in telling tall adventuring stories in [Braggart][Brag] (becoming a club regular at 14 plays) and trying to blast off first in [Welcome to the Moon][WM]. And the final game was a quick round of [Patchwork Doodle][PD] - making quilts on paper out of polyminos.

The next session is 16th October where another interesting range of games will be played. You can use [Discord][Contact] if you want to suggest any specific games so we can set up some matches with other keen gamers.
