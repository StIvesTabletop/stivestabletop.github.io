title: Eighty Eigth session - Stories, Planets, and Space
---

Sixteen gamers .... 

[Arcs][Arcs] was back, and this time we brought Leaders and Lore. This
is an added layer on top of Base Arcs, which brings the game a bit
closer to Root by giving each player an asymmetric power. The Leader
bestows a benefit and a drawback, while the Lore gives a benefit;
together they can radically shift your focus for scoring
points. Unlike Root, the Leader and Lore cards are drafted at the
start of the game (a bit like Age of Innovation, among many other
examples of this). Three players sat down to tackle this wild new take
on Base Arcs: Simon (Elder + Raider Exosuits), Janek (Demagogue +
Keeper's Sol) and Ryan (Mystic + Empath's Bond). It was a close fought
game, but two very lucky dice rolls (getting six hits on six dice, and
rolling enough keys to steal vital resources and cards) swung the game
into Simon's favour. (We did include the Leaders&Lore expansion, which
just adds extra cards to those already in the main box - don't know
whether any of those selected came form that mini-expansion or
not). Arcs is something quite interesting, it's close quarters combat
with the outcome of the game hanging by a thread - not for everyone,
but quite the experience. The Leaders and Lore seem to make Base
shine, although I suspect some combinations will be very good against
others and learning to "read" that at the start of the game will be
hard.
