title: Thirty first session - Pre Jubilee Pandamonium
---

A good session on the eve of the Jubilee holiday with 12 gamers across 3 tables playing 7 different games. 

Early arrivers started with [Big Dig][BD] which had made its debut last session [session 30][30] and then [Incan Gold][IG]. In the first players are miners digging out or connecting up various items on the game boards using tetris style shapes. While [Incan Gold][IG] is a push your luck mechanic whilst exploring the temple, stay longer to acquire more share of the treasure but if two of the same type of hazard appear you lose it all.

Catherine D. led a 4 player table trying two Eastern themed games, first [Takenoko][Tak] a game of gardening bamboo and hungry pandas, and then also back from the previous week [session 30][30] - [Namiji][Nam], a game of fishing off the coast of Japan. [Takenoko][Tak] has 3 types of goals; growing bamboo towers (of certain colours) to specific heights, placing garden zones in certain patterns or feeding the panda certain colour combinations of bamboo. Each turn you only have 2 actions, though the weather dice will provide some random bonuses. First to achieve 10 goals wins but the other players will be constantly changing the garden to meet their goals and possibly thwarting you.

Jeremy J's table chose [Museum][M] back for its second play at the club, last seen [session 20][20]. It had been a few months since this one had been played so there were a few glitches explaining the rules but soon the 4 Victorian era curators were filling their museums with interesting artefacts and trying to obtain the best display based on sets of either geographical or artefact types.

Rich W. had brought [Automania][Au] so the final table settled down to building, customising and shipping cars for autobucks and victory points. Each player is managing a car factory, producing 3 types of cars, there are different but intersecting conveyor belts for each car type and the different parts of the factory can be upgraded for overall quality or specifications like speed or safety. The game runs over 4 rounds and each round the US and European markets change to favour different specifications changing their value. Upgrade the production line, generate cars, choose which market to sell to, load up the ships and then sell at end of round by highest value car first. To do well you need to balance the money vs the victory points earned and loading ships with cars early in the round to sell for higher or getting the best factory upgrades. In the end it was a close game with only one point in it for first place.

All three longer games finished at about the same time, so those that could stay later all joined up for one final game, [Welcome to the Moon][WTM] which was back from [session 28][28] for its fourth outing. A nice short game (approx 20 minute) of flip and write to finish on. Every player has the same setup and options over the game so the winner is determined by who has used those most effectively. As there were a couple of new players we used the initial board, the aim to load your rocket and blast off first. Natasha M. made best use of filling compartments to gain their bonuses and set off for the moon. When enough members know the basic rules we should be able to try the more advanced boards (there are 8 in total, subtly changing the rules each time) progressing through arriving on the moon, setting up the colony, surviving a virus and finally fleeing again to search the stars for a new planet to colonise.

Next session is June 15th, hope you can join us. Do watch out for the pre session [Discord posts][Contact] where there are some discussions of game requests and pre night bookings of longer games.
