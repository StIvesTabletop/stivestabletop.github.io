title: Forty eighth session - Adventuring parties
---

This was an 18 person session including 4 newcomers and saw the return of role playing with a Dungeons & Dragons one-shot. Also many of the board games had an exploring, mapping or treasure seeking theme.

Most of the [Clank][C] team returned for another attempt (see [session 47][47]), this time hoping to make it out of the dungeon still walking or at least limping but they knocked the action up a notch with [the Mummys Curse expansion][CMum]. This time one adventurer did make it out under their own steam, 3 were dragged to safety by helpful villagers and there was only one fatality in the depths of the tomb. But everyone had fun with the Egyptian theme, the addition of curses, and either avoiding or towards the end actively seeking out the Mummy.

Short games this session were club favourites [Ecosystem][E] and [Tomb Trader][TTr] and also new games for the club [Ukiyo][Uk] and [Night Clan][NCl].

[Ukiyo][Uk] is a very short (approx 5 mins) tactical puzzle-based card game with a deck of just 18 cards. With multiple players they cooperatively lay cards down horizontally or vertically to create patterns of symbols within a 6x6 grid aiming to complete the task on the last card left in their hand.

[Night Clan][NCl] is an area control game. Players start with an identical 13 card deck and need to place their cards 2 at a time in different locations, the aim being to hide your daughters and wealth around the town of Bergen before the troll arrives at nightfall. Once all cards have been played, each location is resolved and any remaining cards are used to determine which player has successfully prevented their scoring cards from being eliminated.

When the longer games started the other 2 tables tried [Verdant][Vd] back for an second session of houseplant arranging last seen on [Session 44][44] and new to the club [Endeavor][Edv].

[Endeavor][Edv] is about exploring the globe and claiming territories for your seafaring empires. Victory points are based on glory acquired for your empire which are obtained through Industry, Culture, Finance, Politics, and occupying cities. The game is played over 7 rounds with 2 phases. The first phase is building, gaining population markers and retrieving finance markers based on position on the various progress tracks. Then there is an action phase; Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Shipping opens new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and generates Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw. The round is over once all players have passed. In the end Graham's slavery based tactic prevailed as it gave him an early advantage and no one had abolished slavery by the end of the game which would have generated penalties.

After Verdant finished the table tried a roll and write game [Cartographers][Cg]. Here the Queen has sent out her cartographers to map and reclaim the Northern lands. The Queen announces which lands she prizes most but the Dragul will be building outposts to contest your influence. Played over 4 seasons the player who can earn the most reputation by satisfying the Queens edicts will win and everyone should have produced some interesting maps.

Last but not least the role playing table had a busy night starting a one-shot [5th Edition D&D][DND5] scenario, [read about what went on....][RPG]
