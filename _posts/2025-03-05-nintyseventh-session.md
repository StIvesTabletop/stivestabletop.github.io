title: Nintyseventh session - Work of Art
---

Seventeen gamers joined us for a night focused on longer games about efficient work practices, art dealing or surviving the horrors of Cthulhu or Aliens.

Games by [Vital Lacerda][BGG_VL] have been popular at club recently and there were two pre-booked on Discord before the session, [Kanban][Kb] and [The Gallerist][TGa].

Neil O. had brought his copy of [Aliens: Another Glorious Day in the Corps!][AGC] so the club could try scenario two in the campaign. Things had not gone very well in the first attempt at this cooperative survival game in [session 81][81], but miraculously the team were alive but separated and ready to face the Aliens again. We had 2 players back from the first game (Neil as Frost, James as Vasquez), joined by 3 first timers (Dave as Ripley, Kathy as Hudson and Jeremy as Gorman). We may have misinterpreted or forgotten a few of the rules but sometimes in our favour and sometimes not, so these mistakes probably balanced out. Four of the marines had become separated from Lt Gorman, Ripley and Newt, who were conveniently in the crashed APC with a computer right by the exit. Less conveniently the win condition was for at least one of the four privates to survive and escape the nest of twisting tunnels full of slavering Aliens and reach the exit too.

Things started well with Vasquez almost single handedly obliterating the first posse of Aliens blocking the corridor with the Smart gun, letting the privates head off as fast as possible. Lt. Gorman and Ripley decided to venture into their end of the corridor and try and keep the nearby spawn point under control. Gorman spent the majority of the game rolling terribly and watching Ripley kill all the spawning Aliens. Meanwhile Newt (a non-player character) was safe in the APC with the computer mashing the keyboard and failing to do any useful Alien scanning due to her poor tech skills (for future scenarios we will remember that Newt could be persuaded to just sleep through the chaos as the Rest action would have been more helpful to recycle cards and extend the game time!).

The troop were about halfway to the exit when the difficulty started to increase and Aliens were appearing multiple times from each spawn point, remembering the tunnels and the ceilings and it was impressive how many times the blip token turned out to have 5 Aliens on one hex, presumably all acrobatically balancing on each other. Vasquez again was critical for thinning out their numbers, as was the flamethrower wielded by Frost, but disappointingly the grenade thrown by Hudson turned out to be a damp squib as another series of poor dice rolls failed to decimate an accumulation of Aliens. Somehow by using every special card and just having enough endurance the whole team made it out. "Game Over, Man!, Game Over!".

![Elder Sign](/images/posts/2025_03_05/ElderSign01.jpg "Elder Sign"){:class="img_post"}

For the final table Richie taught [Elder Sign][ES], new to the club, a lighter weight more dice based reimplementation of cooperative Lovecraftian themed Arkham Horror.
Players investigate the Arkham museum and its surroundings to locate Elder Signs, which are eldritch symbols used to seal the Gates to the Beyond before a final battle with the Ancient One.
