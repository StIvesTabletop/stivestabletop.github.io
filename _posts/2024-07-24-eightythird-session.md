title: Eighty Third session - Power Struggles
---

Seventeen gamers arrived this session for a room filling five table session with four new games and four returning games being played.

Three of the games had been pitched in advance on [Discord][Contact] and had most of their seats pre-booked. The session started with Steve L. setting up the many components for [Nucleum][Nuc] while the rest of the early arrivers got stuck into [Roll through the Ages][RttA] and [Tsuro][Ts]. 

[Roll through the Ages: Bronze Age][RttA] is a bit like [Yahtzee][Y], with dice rolling and locking in choices with the selected faces scoring points on a Bronze Age themed score pad.

[Tsuro][Ts] is a very simple tile placement game that scales to large player numbers so we had seven players trying to stay in the game the longest as the tiles extend the paths their counter is on, but if they meet another player or go off the edge of the play area they lose. See [session 74][74] for a longer description.

Then the long games could start with people breaking away for [Nucleum][Nuc], [Scythe][Sy] and [Crown of Ash][CoA]. Leaving the remaining players surveying the offerings on the games table and selecting [Maglev Metro][MagM] and [Pandemic][P].

Three players got stuck into [Maglev Metro][MagM] the only train game of the night, but one with a futuristic levitating train setting with a nice mechanic where the tracks are on transparent hexes and can build up over the course of the game. We played the Manhattan map which starts with a three hex hub and then extends over rivers and around Central Park over the course of the game.

The game is all about efficient use of actions to develop your track network and collect robots and passengers and deliver them to their destinations. At first you can only collect robots and once delivered they are added to slots in your player board and start unlocking more actions and that is where the crucial choices begin. Do you increase the number of actions (start with two), increase the amount of track you can lay in an action, or how far your train can move, the capacity of the carriages, number of passengers that can be picked up or put down or use them to unlock the ability to build passenger stations and transport the four different colour passengers or put them in the victory point enhancing zones on the board, so many choices!

James T. got off to a fast start opening up the passenger section of his player board early while Darren C. and Kathy J. struggled to collect and deliver the right colour robots to do the same. After that there was no stopping James as he built up an efficient network for delivering purple and lilac passengers and covered most of his player board by the time the last passengers had been drawn from the bag signalling the final round. Kathy J. tried to catch up with a decent delivery of pink and coral passengers (that tied in nicely with her secret goal) and also by connecting up lots of stations (as completed links also bring in victory points) plus she just managed to fill in the multiplier for that on her board. Darren C. suffered from the teachers curse and got stuck at the bottom of the board with all the rivers and long distances to transport passengers to get them delivered and boost the options on his player board. It is a well designed game with nice components and now some of the dependencies on the player board are better understood from this introductory game it would be good to try and give James more of a challenge in a future game.

![Pandemic](/images/posts/2024_07_24/Pandemic01.jpg "Pandemic"){:class="img_post"}

Three gamers decided to step into the shoes of CDC response specialists by playing [Pandemic][P] with Oliver W. taking on the role of lead Scientist - able to find cures with 1 less city data card, James T. (the younger) was an all round generalist - having 5 actions instead of 4, and Jeremy J. was a dispatcher - able to co-ordinate meetings by flying and ferrying players around the board to share information.

The random scenario started with us being based in Shanghai, where a major epidemic of the red virus was already in full swing in Asia. We started off well with the team gaining a cure for red quite quickly and keeping on top of things reasonably well, but then a double outbreak in South America, soon followed by one in Africa was the start of our troubles with the yellow virus in the global south. We carried on and managed to totally eradicate the virus in the west (where there had been little or no blue virus), and find a cure for yellow which allowed us to trigger a rapid vaccine deployment to get it better under control. Unfortunately two very close together new epidemics caused a cascade of outbreaks across the world ending in India which meant we lost the scenario as the viruses had got out of control.

We were not ready to call it quits, so tried again with the same specialists and same base in Shanghai. This time the random set up started with a similar major epidemic in Asia, but the rest was more evenly spread across the world. With some careful meet ups and lucky draws of city data, we managed to eradicate the red virus which gave us more breathing room when the virus spread or the epidemic hit an Asian city as we could ignore the outcome! With a very useful government grant to build another research station we soon had the yellow and blue viruses cured. It took a few turns to then pull together enough city data on the last virus, and though we got hit with another epidemic things were in much better control and so we triumphantly saved the world!

The session ended with the twenty fifth play of [Ecosystem][E] to finish the night after successfully saving the world whilst the other tables scored up.

The next session is the 7th of August, join us to see the many different games on offer, old and new, many themes and game mechanics. [Contact us on the Discord forum][Contact] if you want to suggest a game in advance, that can be very helpful if you want to try a long or complicated game so that it can get started early or players can watch a how to play video first.
