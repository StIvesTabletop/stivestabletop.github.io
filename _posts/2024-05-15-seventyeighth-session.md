title: Seventy eighth session - Gamers wouldn't give a 4X game for anything else
---

Twenty gamers joined the club for several favourites and quite a few new games, with themes spanning the 4Xs - eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate.

Some of the shorter games played during the club included [Parks][Par] - exploring through the national parks in the US; [Sagrada][Sag] - expanding your stained glass masterpiece; [Cartographers][Cart] - mapping out your newly explored region; [Point Salad][PS] - exploiting vegetables for points!; and [5-Minute Dungeon][Five] - involving cooperatively exterminating the denizens of a dungeon to escape, or being exterminated if you run out of time!

[Concordia][Con], another club favourite was then set up for a 4 player game by the time some of the shorter games ended.  Committee member Jyo K. was the teacher, with Reynaldo A. and Tasha M. playing for the first time and Darren C. who had played once previously.  In Concordia, players take on the role of Roman colonists exploring the world and developing their economies. The theme of the game is quite simple - the idea is to settle your colonies in various cities on the map that produce five types of resources. Everyone starts with the same set of cards in their hand, each of which allow you to do different types of actions - move and settle your colonists, buy and sell goods, produce resources etc. You score points based on the cities you have settled in and the cards you have in your hand, as each type of card has its own scoring condition. A delicate balance of expansion on the map and buying the right cards that match your expansion strategy is essential in order to achieve victory.

On this occasion, it was a close finish between Jyo and Tasha. Tasha ended up acquiring a lot of points by settling in cities that produce cloth - a very expensive and valuable resource, and also having the Weaver card which gives you victory points for settling in cloth cities. However, Jyo ended up sneaking just a few points ahead by triggering the end game on time and gaining additional points for doing that. This is a game that never fails to impress new players, with several players having gone on to purchase the game after playing it for the first time at the club. This time, it was Reynaldo who ended up making a purchase soon after this session for the two player Concordia Venus variant.

Graham W. finally played his game of [Continental Divide][CD] for the first time. A player on their turn, can buy shares in one railway company, and then build train lines across America for any companies in which they are the largest shareholder. Companies have limited funds and track, and Graham did not count carefully, and got one company stuck! Half-way through the game, with lots of money, and nothing to spend it on, someone discovered Graham had unfortunately got the rules wrong, and we were paying out far too much money!! Graham had used some of this ill-gotten gains to snap up 9 shares in one company - which swung the game. Next time we'll play it properly with a better idea of what we're doing!!

Iker P., James T. and Neil O. played a base game of [Citadels][Cit] which ended with a tight outcome. This is a deduction and bluffing game where players take on roles in each round to represent characters with special abilities. The goal is to acquire gold and erect buildings while constructing a city. 

Iker P. and James T. later followed with three rounds of [Tsuro][Tsu], a tile laying game where player tokens navigate through the board as new paths are being formed. The goal is to keep your token within the board boundaries longer than anyone else's, which becomes harder the fewer tile slots remain unoccupied. James was experiences with this game and it showed, sending Iker home with a lot of learning to do.

The largest game of the night was [Eclipse][Ecl]
