title: 107th session - From the Amazon to India
---

Fifteen gamers and seven different games this session, travelling the world and space with lots of trees, bees, dogs and ghosts.

A couple of games had been organised in advance on Discord, [Apiary][Ap] and a rematch of [Tycoon: India 1981][TI].

TODO - Apiary

TODO - Tycoon: India

Another table got stuck straight into [Life of the Amazonia][LA]. This is a new game to club and soon acquired two new players with its attractive cards, tiles and animal meeples. It is a bag builder, so everyone starts with the same 10 tokens available covering the four resource types; money, leaves, water and fruit. Each round you draw five tokens from your bag and make the most of them, either buying better value tokens, terrain tiles, trees, water lilies, animals (8 types) or scenery cards which give instant or end game bonuses. Victory points come from the three scoring tracks related to how big your forest is and how many plants are in it, the animals which all have different ways to score and end game cards. During the game you can pick up bonuses from placing animals on certain terrain hexes and compost tokens to remove the original low value ones from your bag.

Each player starts with one unique animal that gives a specific bonus such as making one type of item cost less to acquire. Dave (iguana bonus) and James (sloth bonus) both started with a forest and macaw based strategy acquiring tiles with more forest than wetland and water terrain types and planting lots of trees to make the macaws score more. Kathy (hoatzin bonus) went aquatic growing her river and gradually adding more animals to it; frogs, caimans, giant otters and tamarins (presumably in the trees above the river!). After a few rounds the gameplay mechanics had become clear and everyone enjoyed the challenge of utilising their token draws and working towards some of the many scoring options and trying to combine strategies to optimise points. James was the eventual winner with some good track scores, otters, jaguars, macaws and end game cards. 

The final table played a couple of games of [Forbidden Island][FI] to give any stragglers time to arrive. This was a fifth play at club for this lighter cooperative game.

Two intrepid explorers sat down to [Forbidden Island][FI], but were quickly joined by two others who had obviously parachuted in late! We had landed on an island called The Perilous Peaks (a different island configuration to normal), where we unfortunately found both golden lion temples were up the two peaks. With a very unlucky start the waters rose and one of the temples sank and the other was cut off! But all was not lost as we had a diver with us. This fortune was short lived as fate decided we were not meant to succeed, as we couldn't save this lone temple and had to evacuate without securing any treasures!

Undeterred the 4 tried again (on the same difficult island) and this time it was going well, with 2 treasures secured and a third soon to be collected, when disaster struck and the water rose twice in quick succession where both earth temples sank into the ocean, meaning we once again had to abandon the quest without all the relics.

As a change of scene the four failed adventurers then tried [Evergreen][EG] that Richie brought, which is a bit like [Photosynthesis][Ps] but on a grander scale of reforesting a whole planet, rather than just a, err, forest. Each turn players select a card from a tableau of 5, which determines which of the 6 biomes (flowers, ice, rock, grass, swamp, wheat) you can perform one of 3 actions in - plant three sprouts (saplings), grow two trees, plant a sprout and grow a tree. If you don't like the biome card you can instead plant a sprout or grow a tree in any other biome. The cards also have a special power which can plant saplings, grow trees, gain points, place rivers (which help grow 2 adjacent trees) or add a bush (which can help connect trees to form continuous forests). The card left over goes into fertility pile according to biome and is used for final round scoring, so you can try and rig it to a particular biome if you are lucky.

The game is played in 4 seasons with a decreasing amount of turns for collecting biome cards. At the end of a season, you score points for all the trees that gain light and are not shaded by other trees, and your largest connected forest of trees (not sprouts). The sun then moves clockwise around to the next side of your board for the new season. At the end of the last season you also score your fully grown trees according to the sum of symbols on all the fertility cards collected per biome.

In this first game for most (Jeremy had played once before on [BGA][BGA]), the players were trying to figure out good strategies for scoring, with most going for large trees at diagonals so they would score no matter where the sun was. Jeremy was concentrating on largest forest and was getting a tidy sum every season, whereas Richie tried banking on on the most fertile land (grass) and reaping end game points. It was a fun game of building a forest and growing trees, but in the end it was Graham's strategy of building a ring of mature trees around his planet that scored the most points, with Neil's planet coming second, just beating Jeremy by a point. Unfortunately Richie had scored so few points during the other rounds that even though netting 34 points for the fertile grasslands, it couldn't bring him anything but last place.

Then [Mysterium Park][MP] was also back for a fifth play to see if the ghost could influence the psychics to solve another carnival murder. Neil the Ghost had no difficulty in telling two of the mediums who were innocent bystanders and which places weren't the scenes of the crime, it turned out to be more difficult to give the right visions to Richie, even with the other psychics helping. But in the end they reduced the pool of suspects and locations to three and unanimously agreed on the correct culprit - the daredevil artist on the stage - due to some excellent last visions from the Ghost. 

Those that could stay for one last game tried [Spots][Spo], on its third club play, first out in [Session 92][92]. A push your luck dice rolling game. The seven cards with the dice options randomly selected at the game start were an unusual combination making it a bit of a grind to fill the cards but Kathy's slow and steady just won out over Richie and Dave's more risk based approach.

The next session is the 6th August and the first session with the new price rise to Â£7 to cover increased venue hire fees. Bring your games along and choose on the night or keep a watch on the Discord channel to influence or book your seat for those games.
