title: Twenty seventh session - All the Z's
---

14 gamers this session, including one new joiner. Letting us play two long games with a Z theme; Zombies and Zimbabwe and the final table giving Everdell its fifth outing. 

Initial games included a previous pick of [Seven Dragons][7D] back from [Session 18][18] and two new games, [Coloretto][Col] and [Love Letter][LL] with the [Adventure Time theme][LLAT]. 

[Love Letter][LL] is a simple social deduction game, there are 8 role cards but different numbers of each in the pack. You start with one card and pick up a new one each turn, then discard one activating its associated action to try and eliminate other players from the round. Either the last person in or with the highest value role card when the draw pile runs out wins the round and gets a favour from the Princess, first with four favours wins overall. We played the [Adventure Time version][LLAT] with 4 players, with cards updated to include characters from the cartoon and a couple of rule changes compared to the [original][LL] to match the theme.

Another table tried 3 player [Coloretto][Col] which is a push your luck set collecting game. The pack is setup to include cards of various colour sets depending on how many players there are. You score depending on how many cards in 3 colour sets you have collected, if you collect any additional colours these count negatively at the end. There is one row setup per player, each round you pick up a card from the deck and play it onto one of the rows to a limit of 3 cards per row or pick up cards from one of the rows closing it. Do you pick up before too many cards are played of colours you aren't collecting or stay in and hope to pick up wildcards or more of the colours you are collecting?

[Seven Dragons][7D] is another card game, this time playing them to a tableau trying to make a chain of 7 dragon pictures in your secret goal colour or using special cards to move cards around the table or change goals with other players. A simple concept and pretty quick to play so we managed 3 rounds before it was time for the long games to start.

Back again for a fifth session in a row was [Everdell][Ev], with 3 returning players teaching one new player. The table was soon deploying critters and building those woodland cities around the Ever Tree.

Neil O. set up a 6 player game of [Zombicide][Zom] this is a cooperative game to survive the waves of zombies spawning each round. The game comes with a variety of missions with different board setups and goals, we played one where the goal was for one player to reach the maximum skill level of 43, you gain 1 level per zombie killed. The problem is as players gain levels thresholds are reached and this increases the difficulty of new zombies spawned. The highest player level sets the zombie spawn level so focusing on one player gaining experience then means the others are underpowered to deal with the increased number of zombies.

There was one early fatality when a couple of players had become separated from the others and were overrun by the new spawns. The rest held on for a few more rounds finding better weapons and in the end agreed a risky strategy of opening up a new building spawning many new zombies. This provided plenty of zombies to kill and rack up the levels but more zombies to cause problems if the dice rolls went wrong. Finally the end of round spawn meant almost all the available zombie miniatures had been deployed and a horde overran 3 players at once but luckily the remaining 2 now had the opportunity to plough through the horde on the street in a police car achieving the goal just in time.

A new milestone for the club, the first game by the niche (even within gaming) publisher Splotter. Four sat down to play [The Great Zimbabwe][TGZ] a logistics and economics game set in the Great Zimbabwe World Heritage site, the ultimate aim is to build monuments to your chosen god. There are a lot of options and factors to balance to decide the overall winner and cute gold and silver cow tokens as currency. There's a very interesting bid for turn order, where the bids are distributed among the players - so you can go first, but you give cows to your opponents. Although the most fascinating idea in TGZ is how you win, you need to reach a required number of victory points - but this can be different for each player; you gain benefits/advantages and these increase the total you need to reach. Its the cow game you need to play, except the other cow game you also must play that is entirely different ([6 Nimmit][SixNimmit]).
