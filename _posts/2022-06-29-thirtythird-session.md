title: Thirty third session - Mystical Meadows
---

Lots of new games out this session, three new quick options for the start or end of the night and two new long games with a development theme. 13 returning gamers playing 7 games over 3 tables.

Early joiners got started with a 6 player game of [Tiny Towns][TTo]. Everyone starts with a 4x4 grid and a communal set of 7 building card types that require the positioning of certain combinations of coloured blocks (5 colours) in the grid. Once you satisfy the layout you can remove all the blocks and put the corresponding building in one of the previously used squares. Different buildings have different scoring rules or requirements based on the other buildings in the town. Each player also has 1 secret tower card with a unique building block combination and victory condition to add to their town. Play progresses with each player calling out a resource type and all players must take a cube of that colour and add it to their town. Buildings can be converted once the combination requirement has been matched. The challenge is to keep finishing buildings and in strategic places so you can remove the blocks and start new buildings. You are out when your grid is full and blocks are worth minus one point at game end. A fairly simple concept to explain but quite fiendish to actually utilise the space most effectively and not get caught out by block colours selected by other players.

Soon after there were enough attendees to start a 4 player game of [Sagrada][Sag] back from [session 28][28] and the stained glass window themed dice placement commenced.

![Root](/images/posts/2022_06_29/Root01.jpg "Root"){:class="img_post"}

Sophie had missed out on [Root][R] at the [previous session][32] and was keen to play which suited 3 of the players from that last game. Some of whom switched to try new factions while some tried to master the one they had played before in this asymmetric forest conquering game.

![Terra Mystica](/images/posts/2022_06_29/TerraMystica01.jpg "Terra Mystica"){:class="img_post"}

Meanwhile other players had been eyeing up [Terra Mystica][TMy] from the selection on offer and so Simon W. taught this complex terraforming and strategy game. Many of the games mechanics have been reimplemented in [Gaia Project][GP] which has been played in [session 25][25]. With 4 beginners it took a while to explain all the rules and get going making this the latest running game of the night.

![Meadow](/images/posts/2022_06_29/Meadow01.jpg "Meadow"){:class="img_post"}

This left the last table of 4 trying one of Rich's games [Meadow][Me] a very pretty worker placement and tableau building game. A much simpler game to explain so it wasn't long before the players were working through the eight rounds picking up terrain or animal cards and placing them in the tableau. Cards are selected from a 4x4 grid with certain columns biased by being filled from certain decks to focus on either terrain, animal or special cards. Your 4 "workers" have values 1-4 and are placed in notches around the grid where value 1 picks up the card 1 away from the marker etc, so at the start of the round there are 3 ways to pick up each card within the grid but choices become more restricted as the notches fill up. There is also a campfire board, sending workers here allows a change to the standard single pick and place action to gain more cards or more placements. The stone ring also has randomly placed icons each game, if you send a worker to the campfire and have the 2 adjacent icons to an empty stone both showing in your tableau you can claim the stone with your 2 then 3 then 4 victory point marker. In a 4 player game there are only 11 stones so at least one player will miss out on placing all their markers.

![Meadow](/images/posts/2022_06_29/Meadow02.jpg "Meadow"){:class="img_post"}

Finally tableau placement, cards provide icons and victory points but have requirements, so you essentially build a food web, if you have all the icons on show you can place the new card but by covering up one of the requirement icons on a previously played card. For example, to place a frog might require a bug and a certain terrain icon, terrain cards often come with a bug or worm icon, so 1 pre-placed card might meet this requirement, but then placing the frog will cover the bug. Then a bird might require a frog and a worm icon, requiring another terrain card with a worm to be placed first and then a decision to cover the frog or the worm to place the bird, which will depend on what your next plans are. So although these are quite simple mechanisms there are key decisions to be made on which cards to pick up and what order to place your workers each turn and when to visit the campfire. It was quite a close game with 63 points winning but 62, 61 and 56 points following up, with the loser being the one that had missed out on their final campfire bonus so all the tableau scores were very similar.

![Meadow](/images/posts/2022_06_29/Meadow03.jpg "Meadow"){:class="img_post"}

Once the Meadow scores were all counted up the table switched to a couple of games of light-weight [Tomb Trader][TTr] to finish the night. This is a push your luck and negotiation game played over 7 rounds. Each player starts with a secret character card, like the collector or gambler, these roles get additional victory points for certain types of treasure. Then treasures are revealed in the inner and outer tomb with more treasures appearing per tomb as the game progresses. Players secretly choose which tomb they will visit and then if multiple select the same tomb they have 1 minute to negotiate who gets what treasure, fail to agree and everyone leaves empty handed. Everyone has 3 coins at game start to use to sweeten the deals, with coins worth 1 point each too. Treasure cards give a clue which are more desirable to certain characters so over the 7 rounds you can try and work out what people are collecting and factor that into the negotiations. If you get lucky and are the only person to visit 1 tomb you get half the treasure there rounded down. A fast paced silly but fun game to end the night on.

![Skull](/images/posts/2022_06_29/Skull01.jpg "Skull"){:class="img_post"}

The Rooters had time for a game of [Skull][Sk] before they wrapped up. This is a bluffing party game with Mexican day of the dead art themed cards. Cards feature skulls and roses, each player plays 1 card face down in turn until 1 player states they can turn a certain number cards face up and only show roses. Then an up bidding phase commences and the winner must reveal the cards, show a skull and lose one of their cards, the first player to succeed in only revealing roses twice wins.

Next session is the 13th July with 1 game already booked up on [Discord][Contact] so we are looking forward to some Viking related action.
