title: Twenty fourth session - Building Crew
---


16 returning gamers attended the session meaning we needed to build a 4 table 4 player crew for each long game.


But first the short warm-up games were - the popular starter [The City][TC] is now on its 6th session on the tables (for 2 games this session), first played in [session 8][8] (visit that blog for a description of gameplay). While it was first time out at the club for [The Crew: Quest for Planet Nine][TCw] a trick taking cooperative game with a space theme. Many of the nights games involved building and The Crew is a game with fairly quick rounds so this managed 5 rounds early on and then came back out on table later for another 5 rounds for those who could stay a bit later. This made it the most played game of the night and earned it a name drop in the blog title.

Getting [Everdell][Ev] out at the last [Session (23)][23] had stoked some more interest pre-session on Discord so filling a 4 player game led by Jeremy J. was an easy initial table. The game involves building woodland cities of various constructions that can chain as locations for critters. It requires card and tableau management and worker placement to obtain resources and complete various goals.

Ross D. successfully pitched a 4 player game of [Dungeon Petz][DP]. This is a fairly complex game of worker placement and resource management but with very nice artwork and a fun theme. The aim is acquire and grow monsters and sell them on at the right time to maximise points depending on which buyers have arrived or which contests are happening - all before they need too much food or make too much mess!

This left the remaining 8 deciding how to split up when Simon W. arrived with more games to select from and [Concordia][CC] and [Cleopatra And the Society of Architects][CatSoA] made the final cut. [Concordia][CC] was back from [Sessions 13][13] and [17][17], this time a four player game on the Italia map. There is a unique anguish in Concordia when someone builds a house in the same city or province as you, you know that means no one is going to help you harvest goods (play a Prefect) there ever again, and in this game Sicily became home to two then three players and no one wanted to help anyone else that much. Jyo managed a solid win after having a should I/shouldn't I end the game monologue - Simon W. was desperately trying to control his excitment at having another turn, but sadly the game was ended and Jyo won. The opacity of the scoring right until the last points are counted is what makes Concordia a joy to play, you a freed from the microscopic point tally and left to feel your way at a higher level. 

When [Concordia][CC] finished we lost one player, and having little time left after Concordia the table switched to [The King is Dead][TKD]. An Englishwoman, a Scotswoman, and a Welshwoman walk into a bar... and as a backstabbing in-it-for-yourself noble you don't car. [The King is Dead][TKD] is a abstract area control game currently dressed up as a game of politics and influence in King Arthur's court, although it has previously been set Siam (now Thailand) as King of Siam. This is one of those games that is simple to explain each part, but new players struggle to see how it all fits together or even work out that to do. There are two ways the game can end, each with different scoring and a different tie-breaker. The very unique and surprising thing, you only have eight actions for the entire game. There are eight regions that are won by the English, Scottish or Welsh, but as a player you decide which faction to throw your support behind and hope they win; or you sell the land out and trigger an invasion by the French and win by leading a glorious defence (against and invasion you probably triggered). [The King is Dead][TKD] is a game that is hard to explain, but certainly worth playing (a few times); it's not for everyone, but I dispute any boardgamer not been in awe of the design.

[Cleopatra][CatSoa] was last played pre-pandemic and actually on the very first club night [Session one][1] and also [session four][4]. It is a game of Egyptian architects building a palace for Cleopatra, using a market and hand management mechanic. There are 5 main resources, different combinations of which are required to build the 6 palace items (columns, doors, throne, mosaics, sphinxes and obelisks) and each has variations on how victory points are scored. Building multiple items in a round also brings bonuses. However some resources are corrupted and before the final scoring architects compare their hidden corruption points, the builder caught using the dodgiest materials is then thrown to the crocodiles before the others compare total coins to determine the victor.

When [Cleopatra][CatSoa] finished the table switched to [Planet][Plan] another game back from sessions [1][1], [4][4] and [15][15]. This was a switch up in building scale with an entire planet to create and populate. Each player has a magnetic dodecahedron (a 12 sided polygon) that can be covered with pentagons representing terrain. Each round players take turns choosing a pentagon to add to their planet, each pentagon has combinations of 1-5 segments of 5 terrain types. You have entirely free placement on the planet, the aim is to entice different animals to your planet and each has a different terrain preference, if your planet best satisfies those conditions you get the animal card. Victory points are gained from a secret goal based on total segments of a terrain type on the finished planet and the animal cards collected. The rules are very simple so the game can be set-up and explained in 10 minutes even with newcomers but remains challenging to think three-dimensionally and work out how best to terraform your planet. After an initial play everyone understood the concepts and wanted another try.
