title: Thirty fourth session - Lock, Stock and two smoking Volcanoes
---

The games this session had 2 definite themes, temples and volcanoes or stocks and trading. It was a lively session with 12 returning gamers enjoying the aircon at the Corn Exchange on a hot summer day playing 8 different games.

Starter games were [Big Dig][BD] back for a fourth session as warm up game and [Tiny Towns][TTo] which had been introduced the [previous session][33].

Will B. had requested prior to the session via [Discord][Contact] a game or as it turned out three of [Escape: The Curse of the Temple][ECT]. This is a cooperative escape game with frantic music playing in the backgound and equally frantic dice rolling. The chairs had to be moved out of the way so players could stand around the table to see all the action and interact. Six can play and games are only 10 minutes so 7 gamers swapped in and out for the games, the first 2 with the base game and then a third with curses added. Dice faces allow different actions from exploring the temple, revealing new rooms and finding treasures, before finally all players racing to reach the exit tile in time. Dice can get locked by rolling the black symbol face making it more challenging to achieve the right combinations on the remaining dice to explore or loot. The yellow symbol face can unlock dice and other players whose explorer is in the same room can help unlock or achieve goals. The first game was a loss with a few explorers left behind, the second game a success with 10 seconds to spare and the third game was close, but 2 people got left behind. A noisy and adrenaline pumping start to the session.

Meanwhile Simon W. was teaching 3 others [Mini Rails][MR] a train themed stock trading game back from [session 28][28]. A simple concept with only 6 rounds and 2 actions possible each time but a lot of strategy behind it with crucial decisions on boosting the scores of certain colour stocks whilst ensuring you own those stocks to benefit.

Simon followed this up with a 4 player game of [Hab and Gut][HG] about stock brokers during the Industrial revolution. Its played over 2 rounds, in each round there are turns of stock pricing and stock trading. First each player takes a turn manipulating the stock prices - by choosing a card from a selection that can only be seen by you or the person to the left, and a card from a different selection on the right (that can only be seen by you and the person on the right). Once everyone has tanked or inflated the stock prices, everyone gets a chance to either purchase or sell stock (up to three cards) and optionally donate a stock to charity. Play continues until there are no stock manipulation cards left, and the round ends, where the charity donations are cashed in. The next round, new stock manipulation cards are dealt and play continues. Its all about making the the most money, but the stingiest player, with the least charity donations, will automatically lose!

![Tikal](/images/posts/2022_07_13/Tikal01.jpg "Tikal"){:class="img_post"}

Kathy J. brought back [Tikal][Tika] from [session 2][2], a classic game set in the central american jungles of Guatemala discovering temples and treasures in the overgrown ruins of Tikal. Each turn players place a new hexagonal land tile on the board and have 10 action points to best use to move their meeple explorers, discover, uncover and achieve area control of temples, or dig up treasures and swap them to make sets for more points with the other players. Three times during the game when a volcano tile is revealed and once at the end, when the last tile is placed, a scoring round commences. Turn order is important to make best use of action points and stealing control of temples from the previous players. Simple mechanics to teach but some luck in the tiles drawn may have influenced the final result, next time we could play with the tile auction rules to mitigate that.

![Taluva](/images/posts/2022_07_13/Taluva01.jpg "Taluva"){:class="img_post"}

Meanwhile Nathan B. had brought [Taluva][Tv] a game set on a South Sea island emerging from the waves due to volcanic eruptions. Each turn players must add land to the board either adding land to the side or adding height to previously placed tiles. After that players can place buildings or based on placement rules upgrade their buildings. The game ends when all tiles are placed or a player has exhausted their building stocks of two building types. A very strategic game requiring multi-level thinking.

Finally there was time for the some players to have a go of [Tomb Trader][TTr] (first tried [last session][33]), trying to make it out with the most treasure by battering. Simon scored a definite haul by collecting 6 pieces of the Treasure Map. An enjoyable quick game at the end of the session.

Next session is 27th July. Hoping for cooler weather and a drop in virus levels to allow more gamers to attend.
