title: Eighty Second session - Abstract Zombie Explorers
---

Despite having to choose between watching a Euro ball game or playing a Euro board game, eleven gamers turned out for a three table session. They played a few of the club favourites and one new game of exploration.

The session started by filling a table of six for [Welcome to the Moon][WTM]. This is the seventh play of this flip and write game and the players soon got the hang of using the number and symbol combination choices to fill their rockets and then triggering completed compartment bonuses. However James T. worked out the best strategy for using the numbers and filling his rocket to blast off first while the others were about three quarters done.

The second table got out the ever popular starter game [Ecosystem][E] now on its 24th outing at club.


Then the long games started with [Lost Ruins of Arnak][LRA] quickly gaining four explorers and the remaining six taking on co-op [Zombicide][Zom]. Then when Simon W. arrived two players handed over their characters and defected to try [Dokmus][Dk] an abstract strategy game.

Neil O. set up a reasonably simple sounding [Zombicide][Zom] scenario to teach a couple of new players. However things turned tricky from the very first round of Zombie spawns. The objective was to recover five stashes of supplies, of course they were spread across the map in five different buildings and past four Zombie spawn points and unfortunately half the characters had started armed with the worst weapon - a frying pan!

The team bravely opened the door of the nearest building and then stood back as the spawns included two Fattys with their Walker companions and the Abomination! Fatty's require two damage points to kill and only one player had a weapon capable of such power in one strike, the fire axe. Where as an Abomination requires a molotov cocktail to do three damage and that requires getting into the buildings to search for supplies.

The next turns became a strategic test as some players made noise to distract some of the Zombies and limit the numbers pouring out of the original door, some took on the building Zombies and others dealt with the newly spawned Zombies lurching down the streets. Then they decided they had to open up a second building in the hope that would be easier and some better supplies could be found. Fortunately that building was slightly less infested but still it opened up a new front that required care to thin out the Zombie numbers without the players getting hurt. The team kept managing to survive, no fatalities, and made progress across the map but by the end of session time only two objectives had been recovered and they were running out of Zombies to spawn so it was decided the team had to bug out and call it quits.

Three players went to explore the wonders of the island of [Dokmus][Dk]. A brisk game of placing pieces to claim temples, whichget you victory points. Rather like [Kingdom Builder][KB] (which has never been played in-person at the club, but was common in our [interim online days][INTERIM]), all newly placed pieces must be adjacent to one of your pieces already on the board. Where [Dokmus][Dk] gets interesting, is that the board is made of eight tiles that the players can move and rotate; the island has an ever shifting landscape. The powers to alter the island are drafted at the start of each round, making for some hard choices about whether to cause a major shift in the board or go first to grab an important temple (for those all important points). After eight rounds of placing three pieces there is the final scoring.

After Dokmus there was a quick game of set collecting [Subastral][SA] to finish the night.

The next session is the 24th of July, do [contact us on Discord][Contact] if you want to suggest or organise a specific game in advance, otherwise just turn up and see what varied game themes and types have been brought on the night.
