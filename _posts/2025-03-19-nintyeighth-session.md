It was time to catch the [Bus][Bus]. The club is has seen several games designed by Splotter, who have become slightly more "mainstream" of late. However [Bus][Bus] comes from the early days, originally from 1999 (yep, that old), although the copy played was the Capstone reprint from a few years ago (with updated art and components). The aim of the game, get passengers to take your buses to where they want to go (and score yourself some points). This is one of those low scoring games, where a single point is a very big deal - this winner (who was also the teacher and owner) scored 12, that's only 12 passengers delivered the entire game.

What makes [Bus][Bus] special, is that the players build their networks, the players determine where the three types of buildings are, and the players activiely get in each others way and steal passengers using turn order. What elevates it to an exceptional game, is that you can stop time. In the normal flow, passengers want to go: home, to work, to the pub/bar; then repeat. So each round they want to go somewhere different... unless you stop time, and then they want to go to the same place again. Stop time too often, and you rupture the space time continum and the game ends.

Although originally published in 1999, [Bus][Bus] remains a brilliant game where the players drive (pun intended) the whole development of the board and scoring. It also has the honor of being one of the early (exact order is debated) worker placement games. You only have 20 actions the entire game, you must use two per round but can use more. This sets up really interesting dynamics where you can over-invest in a turn to score highly but then run out of action markers later in the game.

After missing the last bus, the table moved on to [Petite Pastiche][PP]. A delightful little game about mixing paint colours to "paint" master pieces - the theme excellently matches the mechanics of set collection and trading in sets of cards to score points. The heart of the game is working out how to most efficiently colelct the right paint colours when adding your blobs of paint on to the pallett. There's also trading between players, which adds a certain "Catan feeling" to the game - drive by a very strict hand limit at the end of your turn (better to make a bad trade that simply discard cards for nothing).

As a bonus, the rule book includes an explanation of the colour model that the game uses (it is not the RGB model of computer screens). This is entirely unnecessary, but adds to the charm of the game. Also, each artwork details who painted it and where it (at time of publishing) was on display.

The end of the game is triggered when someone reaches a certain point total, however you also score for partially completed paintings meaning the person who triggers the end game might not win. A ver close game with final scores of 31, 31, 30, and 26.
