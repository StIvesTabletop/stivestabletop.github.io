title: Fifteenth session - Trading trains, lost civilisations and dystopian worlds
---


Another 3 table session with 11 attendees, all returners playing a varied selection of game themes and mechanisms.

Early joiners tried a quick(ish) game of [Gloom][G], where the aim is to make your family of misfits as miserable as possible then kill them off before your opponents play nice events on them, the winner is the player with the lowest total family score. A somewhat dark humoured game and with an interesting transparent card mechanism modifying the misery value of your family members. A light-weight story-telling ice-breaker as you pile on the improbable events like "Pursued by Poodles" or "Widowed at the Wedding" or conversely need to negate "Delighted by Ducklings" or "Blessed by the Bishop" before deciding the time is right to put that family member out of their misery - "was pushed down the stairs" or "ran out of air".

Kathy J set up [Lost Ruins of Arnak][LRA] a very attractive exploration themed game that has been receiving good reviews in the gaming world which a number of members had requested for the session. The game takes around 30mins per player with a little extra time this session to explain the rules but after the first round everyone had picked up the mechanics and were busy exploring the island, discovering guardians and buying items and discovering artefacts to help with the later rounds focused more on archeological research. Although there were some very different play styles, as there are multiple ways to earn victory points, the final scores were quite close with a spread between 59 and 67. In the end a little luck with the final items available to purchase tipped the balance.

Simon W was very keen to try out his shiny new copy of [Irish Gauge][IG] a train route and trading game with a backstabbing element, pitched to everyone as "choo choo stab stab". This started out quite amicably building train routes and having auctions to buy shares in the train companies, and then earning divendends on the routes. This was until the final couple of goes where the scarcity of cubes in the game - used for divendends and special interest points (cities) - meant that players managed to make certain train companies end up being worthless due to a lack of cubes for divendends! Even so, it was a close game with scores of 86, 89 and 90 pounds!

![Euphoria](/images/posts/2021_09_22/Euphoria01.jpg "Euphoria"){:class="img_post"}

While Ross D was happy to demonstrate [Euphoria][E] a dice worker placement set collection game where the aim is to build a better dystopia!

![Planet](/images/posts/2021_09_22/Planet01.jpg "Planet"){:class="img_post"}

Tables also played some quick games of [Planet][Plan] and [For Sale][FS] to fill in some time and see when the other longer games would finish, these games have played at previous sessions (see blogs [4] and [7]).

As Arnak was just reaching the final round the other 2 tables joined together for a seven player game of [7 Wonders][7W] to finish the evening, a commercial biased strategy from the Pyramids proved just enough to seal the victory.

As always [please suggest][Contact] games you would like us to bring and teach or suggest your own games you will bring next session and be able to introduce to others.
