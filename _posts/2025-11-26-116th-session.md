title: 116th session - Island Adventures
---

12 players joined us for an evening of adventuring to finish off the gaming year.

[Cryptid][Cy] was back for a fourth club play, last seen in [session 75][75]. Four players were searching the landscape hexes for the cryptid monster armed with only a few vague but unique secret clues. Then by asking each other questions and placing markers on the map you can narrow down to the one location where the cryptid is. Most players had worked out what a few of their competitors knew, for example within 3 hexes of a white object, in a mountain or a desert or near an animal territory. But it was Graham that managed to find the unique hex first.

[Ticket to Ride: Paris][TtRP] is a shorter version of the train classic was on its second club play, last seen in [session 76][76]. It was Steph teaching Elliot (a new player), with Darren and Jeremy also up for a game. Its a quick game with only 5 colours of tram-buses (instead of carriages), with a way of getting extra points by doing the red, white and blue routes. At the end of the game, everyone managed their tickets (routes) they had, but Steph had also managed to put down the most tram-buses which caused the last round and put her in the winning seat after all the counting was done.

Then it was time to move onto the longer games.

[Lost Ruins of Arnak Adventure Chest][LRAAC] had a second outing at club this time with the other new Owl temple board selected, original Arnak has graced the club tables 7 times before. Three adventurers chose their roles (Falconer, Mystic and Captain) and set off exploring the lost island and trying to acquire enough resources to work their way up the research track as that is the main focus of this board. The research track allows you to sideline your magnifying glass into a side passage locking in some victory points but then you have to work a new marker, the lantern, up the track as well. There are also half idol token slot jigsaw pieces to collect that bring in victory points and when completed allow an idol to be used with no victory point penalty unlike the slots on the player board. Each player had a slightly different tactic, Richie was racing up the research track and did make it to the top. Natasha was collecting the idol jigsaw pieces for a nice end game points score and Kathy tried a more balanced approach with exploration, guardian taming, research and idol slot pieces. The result was very close with 76, 80 and 84 final points, Natasha had scored the most points but then had a -8 penalty from fear cards making her second, while Richie's mystic had used all his fear in rituals and claimed the win.

Kathy and Richie then had a couple of games of [Kingdomino][King] to finish the evening. This has now been played at seventeen separate club sessions, but is still not rivalling Ecosystem with its 30 session dominance.
