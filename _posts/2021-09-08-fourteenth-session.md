title: Fourteenth session - Clans and Cities
---

11 people turned out for the 2nd session back post-pandemic, 3 new members and 8 returners. Only a few different games played this session, all about building civilisations from clans to cities.

The early joiners started with a couple of games of [The City][TC] then one member had brought [Clans of Caledonia][CoC] and a 4 person game got underway once all the components had been sorted out.

Kathy J then taught the other table [Neom][N] - the City of tomorrow, a 5 player game but with one pair teaming up so 6 could play. The game is very similar to 7 Wonders with a pass the hand, select and play mechanism over 3 eras, the difference being you choose and play tiles to your city grid and have to follow some placement rules. There are multiple ways to earn points and some ways to loose them; by building a ghost town, polluting your residential areas or having no power. Players got the hang of the game quite quickly though there was some initial confusion with selecting the keystones, 3 secret tiles chosen at game start that can be played once per era instead of a tile from the hand, the keystones can net many victory points if placed or paired well with other tiles in the city. Perhaps in the future a beginners game shouldn’t use them until the basics and some of the symbols are better understood. The first game had quite similar scores with the winner only managing 1 point more than the two drawing in second place.

The table decided to play again but this time put in the disaster tiles, and though those don’t need to played as some tiles are discarded during the era, they all were played reducing income or even destroying some placed tiles. Overall scores were lower, but there was a run away winner who had built a city producing most of the resources and including many retail tiles too.

As the Clans game was still ongoing those remaining at the table then played another couple of games of [The City][TC] before it was time to clear up and go home.
