[Oddland][Odd] was a new starter game at club. Played over 7 rounds the gameplay is quite simple, play a terrain card into the tableau, which can overlap previous cards, then place one of your 7 odd animals onto 1 square of that placed card. Each animal has a different way of scoring, usually related to one of the terrain types and score up at the end. The four players were soon adding hybrid fauna like grizzleep, pangeroo and whalephant to the rapidly expanding map. In the final scoring Kathy J. and her excellent owloose diagonal forest terrain score got the win.

[Terraforming Mars][TM] was back with its 10th play of this game at the club. 4 players took on lead positions of corporations that want a slice of the planet, but it was the Tharsis Republic led by Neil who managed to win it this time.

[Leviathan Wilds][LW] was back on the table for some cooperative gaming, this was previously tried at [session 115][115]. There was enough time to try 2 scenarios or Leviathan rescues but the 3 players stuck with the same team of climbers for both. Kestrel the Roughneck (Kathy), Fix the Freeclimber (Richie) and Hornet the Herald (Jeremy) were soon climbing, gliding and sometimes falling around the Leviathans: Sentinel - a tall stone like giant - and Fury - a huge bull like creature with lava for blood.

Their aim was to  break the crystal growths and avoid the befuddled Leviathan's attempts to prevent them. The first game was very close with the final crystal being destroyed just before the climbers were exhausted by their fight against the blight. The second game proved a little easier with the team managing to prevent the worst of the Leviathan's special rage attacks and still have some health left at the end.

[Cascadia Rolling Rivers][CasRR] was the shorter game selected after the successful cooperative Leviathan rescues had finished and the other long game tables were still going. The Rolling Rivers version has been tried twice at club before, the first being in [session 106][106]. It is a dice rolling version of Cascadia, where the dice provide animal choices to collect and then spend on various environment cards to score points. Although it was Richie's first game he optimised his dice rolling and animal collection to acquire the most environment points and a sure win.

Next session is on Wednesday February 4th 7.30pm at the St Ives Corn Exchange. Join in on the night and bring games then play games, or request games and book seats in advance of the session on [Discord][Contact].
