title: Fifty fourth session - Planes, trains and automobiles
---

There were 11 attendees this session and the longer games selected had a transportation theme this week.

Shorter games this session were [Ukiyo][Uk] the competitive pattern laying game on its fourth club outing, [High Society][HS] also out for a fourth time bidding and acquiring wealth for your socialites and [Kingdomino][King] on its seventh session but not seen since [session 17][17]. It was nice to see this quick and simple tile selection and placement game back out with some varied kingdoms being built trying to maximise terrain types and crowns for that score multiplier whilst still keeping to the 5x5 grid.

The longest game of the night was new to the club - [Pan Am][Pan]. So this was our aeroplane game, where the focus was on building an airline empire. The game has a nice retro feel matching its Pan Am era theme. The aim is to outbid rivals for lucrative landing rights and buy planes with longer range to reach the far corners of the world. Claim routes, cope with events, worker placement your engineers and resolve their actions and then resolve what Pan Am a non player airline is doing. The victory condition after 7 rounds is the player with the most stocks in Pan Am. It is a combination of worker placement and auction game mechanics with the overall aim of acquiring stock meaning tricky decisions on how to use your cash throughout the game.

Also new to the club was [Heat: Pedal to the Metal][HPM]. This is a car racing game and four players were soon doing laps of the US themed map and grinding gears or spinning out on the corners. Each player controls one car, we played the basic version of the game with limited special cards, no weather and just two laps of the track (there are four tracks available) so there is plenty of variety and even a four race championship option in the box. Gameplay is quite simple, choose your gear which then sets how many cards from your hand you can play to set your distance travelled that round. Standard distance cards range from 1 to 4, then there are stress cards that let you draw a random distance card from your deck and heat cards that clog up your hand. You generate heat by boosting, changing through more than one gear in a round or trying to go around a corner too fast. If you don't have enough heat cards available you spin out and are reset in first gear before the corner. So the game is about managing your deck to cruise through the straights in high gear and crunch down and safely loose some of that speed before the corners and limit the recovery time after. There is also some interaction between the cars with slipstreaming and blocking.

It took a few rounds and spinouts (3 players managed this) to work out the strategies involved in the corners and when to push your luck with the stress cards. Pole position changed quite a few times during the game so the card mechanic did balance quite well and in the end it was quite close with three players crossing the finish line in the same round and so the victor was the one who made it farthest past the post.

![Azul](/images/posts/2023_05_17/Azul01.jpg "Azul"){:class="img_post"}

The final table had a game of the pretty tile collection game [Azul][Azul], on its third play at the club, and then onto one of Simons train related games. [Gulf, Mobile & Ohio][GMO] is more of a route building and stock trading game set in the South of the US building up to 23 historic railroad routes for companies with two types of stock; charter (for the founder) and common (for auction later). Stock auctions generate funds that can then be spent on cubes to place routes. Routes are designated by cubes and there are only six colours and limited numbers of each available plus placement rules to prevent routes of the same colour touching. Score victory points for building routes, founding new lines and connecting lines and cities until all players pass or the sixth colour is chartered.
