title: 114th session - A cosy corner with Books, Animals, The Pope and some Zombies...
---

It was a busy nearly Halloween session with 17 gamers playing 8 different games, a few of which had a spooky theme.

Darren had pitched [A Place for All My Books][APB] before the session on Discord and had a table full of willing book hoarders ready to get started.

Then they switched to [Skara Brae][SB]

Kathy had brought [Ark Nova][AN] again and had no difficulty tempting 3 new players into trying this popular zoo building game.

With 3 novices it took a little while to explain the rules and get going but people quickly got the hang of the action card sliding mechanic and were soon building enclosures and filling them with animals. Reynaldo started well with some nice complimentary African and Primate cards. However it was Paul that was racing up the conservation track first with a lucky find of a new goal that matched his predator and companion zoo acquisitions. Kathy and Diego struggled to get such nice combinations and were cash starved but started expanding and conserving. Then Reynaldo was able to support some good conservation projects and overtook Paul on that track, so Paul added some new attractive animals and took the lead on Zoo Appeal and also Reputation.

The night was getting late so everyone agreed to have 2 more turns each and count up rather than wait for the score tracker crossover point, though it would not have been many more rounds further on. Diego added some high scoring animals in his last turns to be the biggest scorer on Appeal but Reynaldo was way ahead on Conservation. In the end as no one had managed the crossover when including end-game scores, it was Reynaldo on -14, Paul on -30, Kathy on -32 and Diego on -39. Which made Reynaldo a clear winner and everyone else pretty closely matched. 

The third table played a quick game of [Azul][Azul] while waiting for their final player to arrive. Then got stuck into [Habemus Papam][HP] with a novel theme about choosing the next pope. 

!Simon!

The final table were the ones most on theme for the night with a game of [Zombicide][Zom] and then [Mysterium Park][MP], with the psychics solving a murder in a creepy amusement park. They finally switched to [Railroad Ink Shining Yellow][RIY] to finish off the night.

[Zombicide][Zom]de was brought out at the start of this Hallow's Eve session so a longer scenario "Escape Plan" could be tried. We had six characters on the go shared by 5 people. Neil chose slippery Josh, Richie chose fast moving Amy, James chose even faster moving Wanda (due to roller skates), Dan played Phil - a cop with a pistol, and Jeremy had two characters (at least to start with) - Doug and Ned who both started with pans.

In this scenario we had to find and pack 6 supplies and ourselves into the 2 cars and exit the map - simples. So we started by half of us rushing for the police car for some better weapons, whilst the other half opened the big building that dominated the map - spawning all the contents. Unfortunately this triggered zombies from the sewers to appear - which caused Wanda to be hit and drop her pistol. The next few turns saw Ned, Doug and Josh come to Wanda's help - with only two pans between them - which were tossed between survivors as we tried in vain to whack the zombie! Whilst the others tried to thin out the other zombies, which was going well until Phil met a grisly end due to some spawning runners. With a quick rearrangement - Dan took over Doug and we carried on.

With the lone police car protecting zombie gone, many guns were looted from the police car, including double sawn off shot guns for Doug. Doug and Josh also jumped in the police car and tried to mow down some of the encroaching hoard - which was most effective apart from bouncing off the fatties, and ending up in a bad spot when a runner caught up with them and Josh wasn't slippery enough.

Inside the building, looting was going well with rice, water and canned goods being found, as well as more weapons and a short lived Zombie hiding under some rags. The next disaster happened when Wanda, after looting the pimp mobile for Ma's shotgun decided to skate off and use it against the big zombies, but got jumped and died before using it.

Doug had more fun running over zombies, whilst the remaining survivors, Amy and Ned stashed provisions in the pimp mobile and then drove off to help. Unfortunately things didn't last much longer, the threat level had increased due to all the zombie splatting in cars, and we hadn't thinned out the fatty zombies, which meant they had an extra go and claimed Doug. Soon after Ned succumbed, and then the lone survivor Amy went out in a whirlwind of bullets. We had stashed 2 of the needed provisions, lost 3 others due to deaths, but had racked up about 70 zombie kills between us, though Wanda only had one to show for it.

The next game played was another spooky one - [Mysterium Park][MP] - where 4 psychics tried to understand the visions from Richie (who had died most recently in the last game). Anyway, it was not an easy task handing out useful visions, to everyone, and James had a difficult time figuring out one of the innocents and it took 3 attempts. Deciding the location where the crime did not take place was much easier for James, but unfortunately Dan (even with help from the others) still couldn't guess the his location before round 6. As it was a few players first try and the game we moved onto the final phase and tried to guess the killer and location, but Richie has used up all his tickets (for getting new vision cards) and gave us a pair of cards that completely misdirected us - so we failed anyway.

Saying goodnight to James, left us four to play [Railroad Ink Shining Yellow][RIY] (out last [session][113]), which after a round of refreshing the rules, had us all putting down rails and roads like pros, snapping up the objectives quite quickly. In the end, Richie had made a few wrong turns, so ended up in last place, but the railroad crown went to Neil with a healthy 68 points and only 1 unfinished track.

The next session is the 12th November, do join in on [Discord][Contact] if you want to reserve a space on some of the pre-session game suggestions. 

With the end of the year approaching a reminder that the club doesn't run game sessions in December as people often have clashing activities. There will be a Club Meal at The Welcome Chinese Restaurant on 10th December, if you would like to join us please [reserve a space][Contact] and a deposit will be due in November. 

The first session of 2026 will be on January 7th.
