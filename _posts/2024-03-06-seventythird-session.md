title: Seventy third session - Class warfare
---

This session had 20 gamers with five different games on the go simultaneously. The various games had people trading with trains, dabbling in class politics, stealing from ghost dragons, engaging in intrigue on Dune and building space megastructures. 

Just eight different games this time as a few long ones came out and two completely new games to the club. Six people got the session underway with the traditional opener [Ecosystem][E] but then we quickly got settled into the long games of which three had been pre-booked.

Suggesting [Clank Catacombs][CC] is a completely new game to the club is a bit of an exaggeration as it is a reimplementation of  [Clank][C] that has been played at club five times, also testing out its various expansions. In this version the main new mechanic is instead of a printed board for the gamers to explore, the map is generated through tile placement as the reckless thieves get to the edge of the currently explored areas. Otherwise it is the same deck building push your luck game to grab as much loot as you can and get out safely. There is a new ghost theme with some haunted tiles introducing white ghost cubes to the clank bag which hurt the adventurers when they are drawn out. Also lock picks and more locked places to open up including rescuing prisoners that can have end of game bonuses if you escort them safely to the surface. The game was a bit of a table hog with the randomly expanding map in danger of coming off the edge of the table and lots of other components to accommodate from the market cards, Clank cubes and various treasure markers.

We had three experienced Clank players and two newcomers who quickly picked up the gameplay details and with five players this did fill the session and only just got finished in time. Once all the main treasures had been located and the ghost dragon was suitably enraged by the thieves, all five players turned round and started trying to escape. In the end only one made it out under their own steam and the remaining four succumbed to their dragon induced injuries but were near enough the exit to be dragged to safety and count up their loot. Even without the twenty point bonus for getting out Natasha M. had a significant lead over the others who all had similar scores, with Tom M. just beating the teacher Kathy J. to second place by one point. Jason and James T. were just behind but had enjoyed their first introduction to Clank and seemed keen to try again.

![Dune Imperium](/images/posts/2024_03_06/DuneImperium01.jpg "Dune Imperium"){:class="img_post"}

There was a four player game of [Dune: Imperium][DI] providing some space and spice based intrigue inspired by Frank Herbert's Sci Fi classic. This game was back for a third session, please see [blog 49][49] for a review of the game play mechanics.

![Hegemony](/images/posts/2024_03_06/Hegemony01.jpg "Hegemony"){:class="img_post"}

[Hegemony][Hg] had been pre-arranged and Jyo K. was teaching two new players who had diligently watched a how to play video before the session, so the complex game had a chance of completing within the available session time. This was the second outing of Hegemony at club, last played in [session 61][61].

![Solar Sphere](/images/posts/2024_03_06/SolarSphere01.jpg "Solar Sphere"){:class="img_post"}

[Solar Sphere][SS] is a genuinely new addition to the games at the club - its a competitive game about building a dyson sphere around a star! Ian and Sophie FW. taught Rich W. and Jeremy J. how to get a team together to embark on such a monumental task. Each player directs a small set of ships (dice) to perform various tasks - from collecting resources from nearby moons, defending against ships trying to stop the building, and constructing a section of the sphere. At the start of each round every player rolls their 3 dice to find out what possible actions they can take, turn order is determined by highest roll, though lower rolls get bonuses to your prestige and morale as compensation. Then one by one, players allocate their ships to the tasks available. To perform most tasks players need to manage their set of drones to actually do the work, for instance, they need to commit a drone to be part of the sphere, or to become a satellite to help collect more resources in future. Points are scored for successfully defending against the attacking ships, recruiting ship mates, building segments of the sphere and getting high levels of morale and prestige.

The game was won by Rich who managed to recruit some good crew members (that can be used once each round) to help him build the most sections of the sphere and defend against several ships bringing him a clear victory.

![Dale Of Merchants 2](/images/posts/2024_03_06/DaleOfMerchants01.jpg "Dale Of Merchants 2"){:class="img_post"}

As this was the shortest long game of the night the table then switched to [Dale of Merchants 2][DoM] for an animalfolk themed market stall and deck building game to finish off. See [session 67][67].

![Taluva](/images/posts/2024_03_06/Taluva01.jpg "Taluva"){:class="img_post"}

[Age of Steam][AoS] had also been pre-booked but whilst waiting for the teacher to arrive a two player game of [Taluva][Tv] filled the gap nicely. This is a 3D tile laying lava flow based game last played in [session 34][34].
