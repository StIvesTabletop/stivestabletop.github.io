title: Fifty first session - Ghosts and the Galapagos
---

There were 15 attendees this session making for a 4 table long game split, 2 new games were tested and 2 previously played requests. Everyone was keen to get stuck in to the long games so the shorter filler games came out at the end this time.

Iain D. had requested another try of Medieval themed bag builder [Orleans][O] back from [session 49][49] and soon a 3 player game was underway. Kathy J. tried a fisherman and farmer based strategy this time which was bringing in lots of resource and money but ignored the development track, an important end game score multiplier. Iain went heavy on the carpenters and cogs and this meant he was having more actions each turn as the game progressed and so he finished 10 points ahead. While new player Adam D. focused more on the scholars so did well on development but took a little while to get going on building trading stations around Orleans. Scores were fairly close and it was a fun and non confrontational game making the most of which roles came of out the bag or dealing with the events each round.

Jyo K. set up [Terraforming Mars][TM] and soon had 4 players colonising and modifying the temperature, water and oxygen levels to make the planet habitable.

There were 2 games of [Mysterium][My] with Catherine D. then Jeremy J. as the ghost. The ghost has to give clues to a few murders (one per player) in the house to the mediums (players) through a series of abstract images. The players have to work out the murderer, weapon and room and then in a final round the ghost tries to show which of the individual murders was actually theirs. Depending on how well players have done in the earlier rounds will give them more clues in this final round. Ghost Catherine only had 2 mediums correct and one rogue guess, whilst Jeremy was successful with all 3 player mediums guessing their murder.

The final table of four tried a brand new game - [Darwin’s Journey][DJ]. This involves exploring the Galapagos islands and expanding your biological knowledge. It is mostly a worker placement game, workers learn skills which then allow more complex later actions. It is quite important to progress most skills evenly; exploration, correspondence, gathering, and dispatch of samples to museums. There are many ways to earn victory points and short and long term goals to work towards. The game plays over 5 rounds and is fairly heavy weight due to the number of options available. As it was new it took a little while to get going, making it the last game to finish but there was some very positive feedback afterwards, so it should be back.

Then as the long games finished various table reshufflings occured with those still keen to stay on for a bit more gaming fix. Four very different fillers came out: [Big Dig][BD] for some tetris type speed mining, [Ecosystem: Coral Reef][ECR] for underwater themed tableau building, [Ukiyo][Uk] for some abstract icon placement and [Sagrada][Sag] for coloured dice stained glass window creation.
