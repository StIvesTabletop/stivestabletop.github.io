title: Twenty third session - Wet Woodland Deliveries
---

12 returning gamers attended the session on a typically chilly february evening. We started with a warm up game of [Welcome to the Moon][WTM] for the first 6 to arrive, with 2 players who had experienced the game in session 21 and 4 learners. People picked up the concepts pretty quickly and soon there were rocket sections filling up, system errors triggered and finally blast off. There was also a quick game of [Three of a Crime][ToC], a light deduction game to divert a couple more members until we reached critical mass and could split up for the evenings long games.

Simon W. had posted a [Discord][Contact] message a few days earlier and drummed up some excitement and pre-bookings for [Container][Con] a game about big ships and big production. The evening had 4 players producing goods and shipping other players goods to a remote island.

Kathy J. taught a 4 player game of [Everdell][Ev] which has been requested a few times but the stars finally aligned this session to get it on the table rather than the many other shiny games regularly on offer. [Everdell][Ev] is a game of peacefully co-habiting animals developing a woodland city with gorgeous artwork and components. The game is a combination of worker placement and card choice and play to a tableau.

It plays over the 4 seasons starting in winter with only 2 workers and no resources with players taking turns to consecutively play small actions acquiring resources, constructing buildings and recruiting critters until they run out of options, pass and take the end of season bonuses. Each building has an associated critter, if you can play the construction into your woodland city and then find the critter card they can join for free as a later action.

There are a few ways to generate victory points and a maximum city size of 15 cards (constructions and critters) but of course there is usually a card that can break most rules, like the wanderer that doesn't take up a space or the wife who can share with her husband on the farm. The mechanics are fairly simple, with a nice quirky theme and replay value from randomisation of the the special events available each game and what cards come out of the fairly extensive deck.

Jeremy J. started a 4 player game of [Underwater Cities][UC] which with 3 learners was the longest game of the night and possibly our latest finish so far, but had a very close first and second place finish with only 2 points between them. The game plays over 3 eras with players taking turns choosing a coloured action and if paired with a card of the same colour gaining those benefits too. Resources are generally tight and each round only 1 player can use each action slot so managing play order and decisions on which slot to take are critical.

There are multiple scoring opportunities ranging from one off victory point gains, building city domes and maximising resource production - unused end game resources generate points and domes with multiple building types associated score more. Each player also has a specific mission and can play end-game scoring cards, which are either picked up in game or bought.

A more heavy weight game, but once players have learned the basic mechanics and symbols on the cards, rounds can progress quite quickly. With a lot of cards, potential to randomise starting setup and many possible strategies this is a game with a lot of replay value.

A nice variety of games played and good to be able to satisfy some requests. Do keep [letting us know][Contact] what games you would like to try and we can try to find a member who owns it and is happy to bring and teach.
