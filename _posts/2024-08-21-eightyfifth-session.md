title: Eighty Fifth session - Space for Art, Magic and Wine
---

A very busy night in St Ives with 25 gamers covering six tables with ten different games over the course of the night. A mix of favourites and five new games with a range of themes from the more tranquil wine making and art collecting to magic and space battles.

A few tables quickly got started with their pre-booked longer games, [Arcs][Arc], [The Gallerist][TGa] and [Underwater Cities][UC]. While one table managed to crack through four different games in the night, [Ticket to Ride: Europe][TtRE], [Braggart][Brag], [Century: Eastern Wonders][CE] and [Ecosystem][E], which had already been out as a starter on another table. The final tables chose [Viticulture Tuscany][VitT] and [Res Arcana][RA] followed by [Akropolis][Ak].

![Underwater Cities: New Discoveries](/images/posts/2024_08_21/UnderWaterCities01.jpg "Underwater Cities: New Discoveries"){:class="img_post"}

[Underwater Cities][UC] with the [New Discoveries expansion][UCND] was back for its third club play last out in [session 77][77]. In fact it was almost a rematch of that game with Kathy J., Natasha M. and Tom M. returning while Neil O. was back from the other previous play back in [session 23][23] in early 2022 so he needed a quick rules reminder.

Tom had remembered how useful the museum board bonuses were and focused his strategy on expanding across his board to claim those first and established a good lead with in game victory points. Kathy had intended on a resource building (labs, farms, desalination plants) strategy after selecting the Manager as her assistant which comes with a expansion site building bonus, but then picked up a few cards that worked well together and suggested a sideline in the "shopping" cards. This was working well and she was keeping up with Tom's in game points, but Natasha was steadily working towards her end game bonus of sets of building upgrades with four sets completed by game end. Neil was busy building, with a city and tunnel network covering most of his board including mostly red domes with many desalination plants that would generate a lot of end game points and resources.

Then in the final era it was a race to snag the best end game bonus cards that matched each person strategy and get them played, and try to finish the museum board bonuses to squeeze a few more victory points out of the last turn. The final scores were all over one hundred and quite close with Neil one point ahead of Natasha, Tom a few more points ahead of them but Kathy's museum bonus of an extra metropolis with shopping card based end game score helped claimed the win.

A variant of [Viticulture][Vit] played once before back in [session 17][17], [Viticulture Tuscany][VitT] was selected for some winemaking by the next table. This expansion adds an extended game board, new workers and structures, extra visitor cards and an asymmetric start. The players were soon growing grapes and fermenting the various wine colours in a quest to be the best vintner in the room.

![Res Arcana](/images/posts/2024_08_21/ResArcana01.jpg "Res Arcana"){:class="img_post"}

On a another table, Jeremy taught Richie the rules to the duelling wizards game - [Res Arcana][RA]. They played with both expansions, so this included the extra resource of [Pearls][RAP] and various other items such as the ability to create [scrolls][RAL]. The rules have been explained in more detail in other sessions - [80] and [17]. 

The first game, Infuser versus Healer, saw Richie getting to grips with the rules and learn how to build an effective magical engine for generating victory points. A second match was played where Richie as a Transmuter tried to drain Jeremy's Illusionist of Mana by sending multiple dragons against her. But with a couple of well played defences - a Temple monument and the Alchemist's Tower these attacks were deflected. In the end it was quite a close game with the Illusionist just pipping the Transmuter to scoring the most victory points.

Richie and Jeremy then tried their hand at a new game [Akropolis][Ak] a city building game using tiles consisting of 3 hexes joined together depicting different buildings. The aim is to follow the building placement rules to score points, but you also need scoring plazas of the same building type otherwise they don't score! For added fun, you can also put tiles on top of others to add levels to your city which increases the building values. 

In this game, though Jeremy excelled at housing and universities, Richie was the clear winner by ace-ing all the other building classes - merchants, barracks and gardens - as well as collecting the most stone blocks from covering quarries when building levels. Its a very quick to learn and quick to play game that will hopefully visit the club again.

![Century: Eastern Wonders](/images/posts/2024_08_21/Century01.jpg "Century: Eastern Wonders"){:class="img_post"}

[Century: Eastern Wonders][CE] is a new variant in the Century series which has been on the tables previously [session 45][45] and [session 72][72]. This version continues the spice trading theme but adds a new grid based pick up and deliver mechanic to the usual set collecting and trading up gameplay.

![Ticket To Ride: Europe](/images/posts/2024_08_21/TicketToRide01.jpg "Ticket To Ride: Europe"){:class="img_post"}
