title: 102nd session - Moving Moments

An interesting night that coincided with a Mayoral Mace Ceremony in the hall. The gamers who braved the gauntlet were rewarded with class struggles, planting meadows, train dealing and unknown planets.

The first game of the night was [Wandering Towers][WT] which is a light fun game, only played once before in [session 72][72]. We had two plays, as unfortunately in the first play, Darren and Jeremy who had played before had forgotten the rules, so we played a single card, single action variant as an "introductory" game! On the second play, with 6 wizards using the correct rules, it seemed much more chaotic with towers flying around everywhere and wizards endlessly chasing the black tower. In the end it was Annalee showed her prowess at magic by getting all her wizards into the tower and completing all the required 4 potions before anyone else.

In the background a pre-arranged meeting of classes was happening in [Hegemony: Lead Your Class To Victory][H]

Then some late comers set off to create the best [Meadow][M]. This is a lovely game of choosing cards to form your meadow - both flora and fauna. It has a puzzle element when selecting the cards from the grid of possibilities in that you use numbered workers that can only be placed next to a row or column to select the matching numbered card. The first [play][33] has a more detailed write up of the mechanics.

After chasing towers, the players split up to form two new tables playing [Planet Unknown][PU] and a new train game called [Prussian Rails][PR].

The 4 space faring adventurers playing [Planet Unknown][PU] had played it before, so they tried some new planets and one tried a new corporation as well. You can read about the polymino laying mechanics of this simple but varied planet terraforming game from [session 96][96].

![Azul](/images/posts/2025_05_14/Azul01.jpg "Azul"){:class="img_post"}

After creating the best Meadows, the gamers tried their had at tile laying with 2 games of the fiendish [Azul][A], first played back in [2019][6]. The second game was won by Ian who event though got left with 7 tiles he could not place in the final turn, so racking up many of negative points - he ultimately won the game due to a very good early tile placement gaining a lot of bonus points.
