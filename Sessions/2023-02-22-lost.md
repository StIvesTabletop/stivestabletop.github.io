## The Lost on the Long Road

Story as told by Taevar.

I joined a merchants caravan guard, nothing special, just a job, and that’s where I met them.
Aimee a short, unkempt cleric who followed the Celestial, and a group of three elves.
Seems the older one, not that I can tell an elf’s age - Vaden - had found the other 2, urchins he called them, and taken them under his wing.
Vaden and Arrow were rangers, whilst River was a wizard.
Useful companions, and decent enough as far as I could tell.

The caravan stopped at Triboar, a small town, 1 of the many similar places on the Sword Coast.
That’s where we picked up talk of people going missing on the journey North to Longsaddle, and it was well worn path the Long Road, so a large number of people vanishing smelt like trouble.

So we joined a different caravan heading for Longsaddle, but the trip was quiet, so we decided to return South without the caravan.
That’s when the weather took a weird turn, a thick wet fog appeared suddenly and we ended up losing the road and found ourselves in a swamp.
A swamp that we had no recollection of being near the Long Road.

The night and cold seemed to be closing in fast, and the fog made seeing each other (or much else) beyond about 10 feet impossible.
But cutting through the fog, somehow, we glimpsed a light off in the distance.

The rangers tried to scout stealthily ahead, but the marsh made that difficult, so we all just trudged towards the light.
We eventually found a large iron gate in a high bramble covered wall, with a bright lantern hanging nearby giving off its eerie glow.

Through the gate the mists thinned and allowed us to glimpse a large manor house atop a rise.
River decided, with help, to climb atop the 10 foot wall to get a better view.
Whilst Aimee checked if the gate was locked and then opened it and slipped through!
River scanned the area ahead using her hawk familiar and told us that between us and the house were 3 large dog-like shapes patrolling the grounds.

We all decided that getting out of this wet fog and swamp was better than staying in it, even if this place didn’t smell right.
Going through the gate quietly and closing it, the elves then heard splashing coming from the swamp the way we had come.
Just in case it was a fellow traveller, or occupant of the house we called out, but the reply was guttural and aggressive.

That’s when a lumbering humanoid figure lurched out of the fog and we knew it was undead.
Arrow quickly fired off his bow hitting it and making it stagger.
River followed that with a firebolt, which closely missed it due to it lurching to the side.
It got to the gate and started clawing at it to get through.
Meanwhile, Vaden, who was worried about the dogs hearing the commotion, managed to get off 2 arrows which each hit a dog, but didn’t take them down.
I readied a throwing axe, but we had surprised the dogs so they were still too far away to throw.
Aimee cast ‘toll the dead’ at the thing at the gate, but that didn’t seem to slow it much trying to get in.

Arrow sent another flight into the walking corpse and it went down, now just feebly clasping at the air.
Aimee turned her attention to the dogs and sent magic missiles flying into the unhurt dog.
Vaden sent another arrow at the dogs, but then they were upon us, and they were huge.
They stank of sulphur and the air around them was hot, and their breath was like the heat of a forge.
I sent my hand-axe into the nearest one causing a spray of blood that then evaporated in the air, but still it kept coming.
Aimee summoned a spiritual weapon that looked like a log, which I later realised was a large rolled up paper!
She used the weapon to hit the most wounded looking dog, but still the creature stayed up.

Thereafter, the battle became fierce with rapiers, long swords, frost rays, as well as the magical paper roll, against the vicious attacks of these hounds of hell.
Aimee’s summoned weapon finally took 1 down - cracking its spine - another went down from a fierce rapier blow by Arrow, and finally Vaden skewered the last and only just managed to withdraw his sword before it went white hot.
We hadn’t come out unscathed - Aimee, Vaden and myself had taken some savage blows, so Vaden handed around some good berries to take the edge off.
River investigated the smoking and dissolving corpses finding name collars - Cuddles, Fluffy, and Grim - this spoke of some dark twisted mind.

River’s familiar then noticed that someone in the house had seen us from a window, and shortly after the door to the manor opened spilling light into the ever growing gloom.
A welcoming voice called out to us to come into the house and have some food and shelter.
We couldn’t make out who or what it was, but I decided to shout out and ask where we were as we had lost our way.
Saltmarsh Manor was the reply, which surprised us as we hadn’t heard of such a place.
I then decided I was fed up of the swamp, the fog and the encroaching dark, and even if this was some evil doing, I would prefer to be in the Manor so stomped off up the hill with the rest of our party following.

We found ourselves face to face with a gnome called Grundy who beckoned us in.
He didn’t want to answer our questions, and was unconcerned when Aimee told him about the dogs unfortunately dying at the hands of a ghoul.
I noted for a Cleric she was adept at twisting the truth.
He took us through the hallway which was bedecked with suits of armour, weapons, and trophies, and into the great hall, which was laid out with a sumptuous meal.
At the head of the table sat Lord Gideon Mistmoor of Saltmarsh Manor, who invited us to sit down and eat.

Due to the good berries eaten earlier we weren’t that hungry and anyway, we were still somewhat suspicious.
Aimee discerned that the food held an illusion and confronted the Lord, who withdrew the illusion to show that it was a more simple fare of oat cakes and water, with the excuse that times are hard and with so many travellers visiting they have little to offer.
Asking to know why he uses such dangerous dogs as guards, the lord replied that the swamp is treacherous and they need such protection, and they are easy to purchase from Luskan.
I had had enough of these word games, so stated to my companions we should just search this place, even if he states the travellers stay a night and then leave without harm the next day.
He seemed taken aback by this demand, but relented as long as we took Grundy as a guide.
